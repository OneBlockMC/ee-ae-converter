Lightweight converter to switch tools, armour and books from [EliteEnchantments](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/eliteenchantments-%E2%9E%9C-create-your-own-enchants-%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8F-190-enchants-27-gkits-%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8F-enchant-table-support-%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8F.75061/) to [AdvancedEnchantments](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%AD%95-advancedenchantments-%E2%9C%85-create-custom-enchants-%E2%AD%90-200-enchants-%E2%AD%90-1-8-1-16-3-35-sale.43058/).

### Motivation
[EliteEnchantments](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/eliteenchantments-%E2%9E%9C-create-your-own-enchants-%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8F-190-enchants-27-gkits-%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8F-enchant-table-support-%E2%9A%9C%EF%B8%8F.75061/) has never really worked properly, we've had many issues with this plugin since we switched to it. I've tried creating github issues to no response then I contacted the author was told to chargeback. We needed a way to keep our players enchantments since we had been running this plugin for a while.
